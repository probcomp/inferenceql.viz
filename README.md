# inferdb.spreadsheets

In-browser inferdb demo.

## publishing

`make publish` will deploy the spreadsheet to
https://inferdb-spreadsheet.surge.sh/ . For this to work, you'll need
to [install surge]( https://surge.sh/help/getting-started-with-surge),
and to get added to the project- ask someone with access to add you (they
should follow the instructions at
https://surge.sh/help/adding-collaborators).
